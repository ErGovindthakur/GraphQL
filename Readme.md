## 🔍 What is GraphQL?

- A query language for APIs.
- Developed by Facebook.
- Fetches **only the data you need** in a single request.
- Works with any backend or database.

---

## 🔑 Core Concepts

- [ ] Schema
- [ ] Types (Object types, Scalars, Enums, etc.)
- [ ] Queries (Read)
- [ ] Mutations (Write)
- [ ] Subscriptions (Real-time updates)
- [ ] Resolvers
- [ ] Root types (`Query`, `Mutation`, `Subscription`)

## ⚔️ GraphQL vs REST

| Feature         | REST             | GraphQL           |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Data Fetching   | Multiple endpoints | Single endpoint    |
| Over-fetching   | Yes              | No                |
| Under-fetching  | Yes              | No                |
| Versioning      | Yes              | Not required      |

## 🛠 Setting Up GraphQL Server

- [ ] Initialize Node.js project
- [ ] Install dependencies (`apollo-server`, `graphql`)
- [ ] Create basic schema
- [ ] Set up resolvers
- [ ] Run a GraphQL server

---

## 🔍 Queries & Mutations

- [ ] Writing simple queries
- [ ] Writing mutations
- [ ] Passing arguments
- [ ] Nested queries

---

## 🧱 Schema & Types

- [ ] Defining `type`, `input`, `enum`, `scalar`
- [ ] Required fields
- [ ] Custom types

---

## 🧠 Resolvers

- [ ] What are resolvers?
- [ ] Resolver functions for fields
- [ ] Using context (auth, db)
- [ ] Async resolvers

---

## 🔌 Apollo Server (Node.js)

- [ ] Setup Apollo Server
- [ ] Connect to MongoDB/PostgreSQL
- [ ] Modularize schema & resolvers
- [ ] Error handling & validation

---

## 🧩 Apollo Client (React)

- [ ] Installing Apollo Client
- [ ] Setting up provider
- [ ] useQuery and useMutation hooks
- [ ] Fetching and displaying data
- [ ] Cache management

---

## 🔥 Advanced Topics

- [ ] Subscriptions (real-time data)
- [ ] Authentication with GraphQL
- [ ] Batching and Caching
- [ ] Pagination
- [ ] Fragments
- [ ] Directive (`@include`, `@skip`)
- [ ] Federation & Microservices

---

## 🛠 Mini Projects

- [ ] Basic User API (Query + Mutation)
- [ ] Notes App with Apollo Server
- [ ] React + Apollo Client Todo App
- [ ] Authentication with JWT

---

## 📚 Resources
